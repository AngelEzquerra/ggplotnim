* Plots from ggplot2 book
This directory will contain files (one file for each chapter)
containing all plots the =ggplot2= book by Hadley Wickham contains.

If the code to create the plot deviates from the book, the
corresponding R code is shown in a comment above. Aside from minor
things like using explicit strings in many cases for the =x= and =y=
arguments.
