* ggplotnim - ggplot2 in Nim

This package, as the name suggests, will become a "sort of" port of
[[https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/][ggplot2]] for Nim. 

It is based on the [[https://github.com/vindaar/ginger/][ginger]] package. 

Currently it is in a purely prototyping state. The code as it is only
a proof of concept for myself to see whether =ginger= is at a point
where it's technically feasible to draw =ggplot2= like plots and to
see how well the syntax can be ported to Nim.

On the plus side, thanks to Nim's macro system, even the =~= function
syntax works already, so that one can create a plot like so:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
let plt = ggplot(mpg, aes(displ ~ cty / hwy)) +
  geom_point() 
#+END_SRC 
would create a plot of displacement vs the ratio of city to highway
mpg. All identifiers appearing in the formula are taken to be strings,
which should appear in the data frame we give to =ggplot= (currently
it's just using =Table[string, seq[string]]=. 

The formula mentioned will be stored as =(displ (/ cty hwy))= and a
proc can be used to apply the mathematical functions in the correct
order to a data frame given.
Although at the moment the input to =aes= is not implemented, but for
a working proof of concept, check out the tests.

** Examples

The following are just the first plots I reproduced.

*** Scatter of displ ~ hwy

*** Scatter of displ ~ hwy, class as color scale

*** Histogram of hwy
